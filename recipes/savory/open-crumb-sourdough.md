# Open Crumb Sourdough

The goal of this recipe is to create fluffy sourdough bread that features an
excellent open crumb. The crumb should have evenly spread alveoli. The crust
of the bread should be thick and crispy, feeling almost like if it was fried.
That way you experience two different consistencies thus creating a more
wholesome taste experience. This is the kind of bread that you want to bring
when you have been invited by friends. It looks so stunningly beautiful that
your friends will wonder if they are truly allowed to slice it. The amount of
flavor that this loaf has is unique and truly unbeatable. It can be eaten
pure or with a little bit of butter, anything that does not overshadow the
uniqueness of the bread's flavor is allowed. This is truly the bread master piece
that leaves every bread that you can buy in other bakeries behind by light years.
This bread is the perfect combination of consistency, flavor and visual
beauty. Having tasted this bread once, all other breads from that moment on
will feel inferior. I am warning you - once you achieved this masterpiece,
you will be addicted and can never go back to eat regular bread again. Be
wanred that your friends will invite you over for dinner, assuming you will
bring the bread. The bread will be the star of every dinner to which you bring
it. This book documents my quest and will hopefully teach you how to achieve
the perfect bread.

Please note that this is by far the most complex bread you can bake. All the
parameters depend on each other. If you commit a small error at one of the steps,
chances are you will not be able to create a similar product. One slight
error will make the whole house of cards collapse. Learn from your errors and
try one more time. It has taken me approx. 200 attempts and 400 hours to get
this recipe right. This is also by far the most time intensive bread that
I have baked. The dough requires working, you need to carefully
observe fermentation. 2 hours per loaf is a realistic time. It would be
interesting to know if similar bread can be achieved by using more tools and
automation, or whether it remains artisan craftsmanship.

Furthermore different temperatures, different flours all result in you
requiring different dough handling than I do in this recipe. Which means that
even if you follow my recipe a 100% chances are your setup is not able to
produce the same results as my setup did. Please open up a Github issue
listing some of your parameters and I am more than happy to help. Hopefully we
can adjust this recipe then to help others from commiting the same mistakes.
Throughout this guide I will try to explain all the pitfalls I encountered with
possible fixes for them.  I have always used the same base recipe,
trying to only change 1 parameter at the time. That way I could improve
from bread to bread. I tried to be as scientific as possible, but
sometimes I accidentally changed multiple parameters. Sometimes I would do one
step a few minutes later simply because I had to finish drinking a beer, going
to the toilet. It's very hard to repeat exactly the same process throughout
every bake, but try your best and you will be rewarded.

Do not feel demotivated if you can not complete the recipe with similar results
right away. As said, feel free to open up an issue here on the repository to receive
further advice on what you should look at.

## Preparing your starter

The foundation of every bread is a healthy sourdough starter. A small portion
of sourdough is mixed into your bread to start the fermentation process. This
dough is called the starter or levain. I had to learn the importance the hard
way. In fact, I had started to master all the steps, what was missing was
simply a healthy starter. So simple, but I was so much focused on my
technique that it took me a long time to realise that the foundation of my
baking was weak.

The breads I made had great taste, but very visually not appealing.
When working the dough it almost always stuck to my hands. The dough was super
sticky. I was wondering how people could handle such sticky dough? Most
recipes call for something around 75-85% hydration. That's 85 grams of water
per 100 grams of flour. The dough in my case stuck to my hands, kitchen
surface and ultimately the baneton. Loafs with 65 or 70% hydration would turn
out okay - not having significant oven spring.

My sourdough was too sour. The sourness in your your sourdough comes from
bacteria that produces lactic and acetic acid. This acid infuses the sour
taste to your dough. At the same time the acid improves shelf life of your
product, preventing mold from entering your dough. The reason why your dough
sticks together during fermentation is gluten. Gluten also traps the air
created by the fermentation in your your dough. A healthy strong gluten
network is the basis for baking a bread that has an open crumb and rises well
in your oven.

So my starter `Breadly Cooper` seemed to produce too much acid. I verified
this by buying a pH measuring device. My starter would have a pH before baking
of around 3.2. Whereas other peoples starter was less acidy. The acid impedes
the development of the gluten network. At some point the network is damaged.
Thus your bread then just turns into a sticky mess. I was shocked to learn
that my 2 year old sourdough might have reached its end of life. But that is
normal. You might at some point have added different bacteria. That bacteria
ferments faster and creates more acid. Overall your sourdough is a living
organism. You might want to try creating a new sourdough.

Another factor contributed to my lack of oven spring and dough flatness. I
would usually ferment my doughs over night, as the dough would not grow as
much as it did for others. Then after a couple of tests I realised a warmer
temperature is beneficial. Regardless, my sourdough would never double within
4 hours in size. So I had to increase my fermentation times. My dough became
much easier to work with after exchanging the starter. I could do stretch and
folds, my hands were not covered in dough after. However - after 8 hours of
fermentation or so the dough suddenly turned into a sticky mess again. I
observed similar issues when I fermented my dough over night. In the morning
the dough became so sticky. It was impossible to work the dough without adding
additional flour. When researching I saw people easily handing 80% hydration
dough. Something was way off. I improved my technique but still my dough was
more sticky. This seemed especially true for doughs that have high hydration.
Doughs with less hydration could easily ferment for longer periods.

I observed that over time dough seems to degrate. Conducting more research the
phenomenom is known by other bakers as `Gluten rot`. Since enzymes become
activated after water is added, the gluten is slowly transformed. Which makes
sense, since the seed needs sugars to grow. A similar process has been used
for thousands of years when brewing beer. You soak the grain in water. After a
few days the hull degrades. Some content of the grain transforms into
sugar which can be eaten by the endosperm.

This means you can not simply let your dough ferment for longer time
to compensate for lack of gas development by your starter. You have to maximise
fermentation speed in a short period of time. If you wait too long, tiny pockets
of air in your dough aka. alveoli collapse again. When taking to wine someliers
you learn that one of the qualities of wine comes from the yeast that ferments
the sugars. The yeast creates the unique taste of a wine. Some someliers
explained that a wine without might have 10 different taste notes, after
proper fermentation it multiplies. Back to baking bread, the fermentation
causes the unique taste of your loaf. Longer fermentation might create better
taste in your bread. It all seems to boil down to finding the perfect
combination of all the factors. On a site note - similarly to sourdough -
wine can also be fermented over a longer period of time, without adding
commercial yeast. Yeast naturally enters the crushed grapes and starts the
fermentation process. This technique however is way more difficult than
using commercial yeast, as the yeast might change from year to year. A somelier
has to pay close attention to the development of his product. For commercial
wines the whole process might not create significant good product from year to
year, thus most wineries utilise commercial yeast today.

All this talk about fermentation times, gluten degradation boils down to one
learning that you need to apply when baking. You need to make sure your
sourdough is super active, able to create the amount of gas that you need to inflate
the dough properly. My freshly created sourdough would need around 8 hours
to double in size at room temperature. I saw videos and guides where people
explained how their sourdough could triple in size in about 4 hours. I knew I
was onto something and started experimenting with the goal of making my
starter more active.

The quantity of yeast plus its activity in your sourdough is essential.
To make sure your yeast is as active as possible you need to feed it. This
means if you have your sourdough in your fridge, it can take up to 3 full days
to get it to its same activity levels again, before freezing it. I would only
bake on the weekends mostly. I took the sourdough from the fridge on Fridays,
then baked on Saturdays. This was way too little time for sourdough to become
super active again. Instead I would now take my sourdough with me whenever I
traveled. I would always have a small scale plus some flour with me as well.
By doing so I made sure my sourdough always had maximum activity.

`TODO - enter picture of sourdough on a plane here`

Most guides suggest to create a sourdough starter over a week, then you can
use it to bake. This is true if you don't care that much
about dough degradation. A rye bread is a good example, there's almost no
gluten, you can not create an open crumb. You can just let the whole bread
ferment longer, not having any negative impact on the product. The opposite
happens, the bread develops more taste and has an increased shelf life.
However a freshly created sourdough needed way more time in my case. It
took me approx. 2 weeks to get my sourdough to a state where it was active
enough. It could triple in size after around 3 hours at 27°C room temperature.
Feeding your starter with rye can help, as rye naturally has more yeast
contamination. The added yeast expoententially increases in quantity rapidly.
The rye trick should only be applied during feeding cycles, not before the
actual bake. Rye in general impedes gluten development. Thus your crumb
will not turn out as open. I like to have a variety of different
yeast and bacteria in my sourdough. That's why I also feed my starter with
spelt, einkorn or emmer. It would be interesting to conduct further research
on sourdoughs from all around the world, which ones seem to be the most
active.

So lets get your sourdough nuclear. This guide assumes you already have a
sourdough starter. If not, you first need to make one. This is not part of
this guide.

For 4 days in a row you will do the following, twice per day:
1. Take 40 grams of sourdough
2. Feed it with 40 grams of full grain flour
3. Apply 40 grams of water.

The water should be around 20-28°C. It's important it is not too cold.
Temperature greatly impacts fermentation times.

Take a rubber band, or a pen to indicate the initial expansion of your dough.
This allows you to see how active your sourdough is. Place the container in a
warm environment in your house/flat. It shouldn't be too cold. In my case I
placed the dough in my bathroom where I constantly had around 22°C.

After 12 hours return to your sourdough and check whether it has expanded in
size. Take a new jar and repeat the same process with now **40 grams of
sourdough from the initial feeding**. This means your sourdough always has fresh
flour to feed on. You divide it into 1/3. This also has the advantage to leave
over fermented, too sour parts away. In the jar from the initial feeding you
should still have some sourdough left, probably around 75 grams, as you always
lose some product during fermentation. This old sourdough could be used to
bake a rye, emmer or einkorn bread - anything that does not need gluten
development. You could also make sourdough pancakes, sourdough crips,
sourdough pasta, or anything you please with it. Some bakers just discard that
sourdough. I like to store that highly fermented sourdough in an additional
jar in my fridge, ready for use whenever I please.

`TODO - enter some pictures of discard sourdough products`

After 4 days your sourdough should be way more active than it was before. If
it is not, then you need to repeat this process. As suggested, eventually
switch to rye feeding for a day. My sourdough is able to rise to 3 times
its size within 4 hours. Baking a bread with an open crumb does not work
if your sourdough is not similarly active. I had to learn this the hard way.

I usually get up at 8 AM the day I want to bake. I had fed my sourdough in the
night at 10 PM. I won't use that starter to bake, instead I feed the sourdough
one more time in the morning. I place that sourdough starter in my oven with
lights on. That way I have around 27°C in the oven. After 4 hours the sourdough
has tripled in size. If it does - you are ready to go. You have the rock solid
basis to bake an amazing bread.

## Autolyse

Take the large pot and place it on your scale.

* Add 320 grams of all purpose wheat flour
* Add 80 grams of full grain wehat flour
* Add 320 grams of water at 23°C. This means you have 80% hydration.
* If you have 2 banetons, you can also double all the quantities and make two
  breads. During the preshape phase, the dough is splitted into 2 pieces.
  This allows you to A/B the last stages of the baking process.

Stir all the ingredients together with your hand for around 2 minutes. Just
move your hand around in circles, until everyhting has been nicely mixed
together. Make sure there are no chunks of flour left at the bottom of the
pot. The dough will look like a sticky mess. This step is to have the
flour absorb the water. Furthermore the atoms will
homogenize and spread evenly throughout the dough. This will already
give you basic gluten structures.

Cover the pot with the lid, you do not want the contents to dry out. If you
use a bowl, you can instead cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

## Add sourdough

After 2 hours we will be adding our sourdough starter. It must have tripled in
size since you created it initially. Take out 80 grams of your sourdough
starter and place it in the same bowl. That's 20% starter. Overall our bread
has a final hydration of 81.8% (360 grams of water with 440 grams of flour)

Incorporate the sourdough with your hands. If you pull parts of the dough
where no starter has been added, you will notice how well the dough already
sticks together. This is the basis for a good bread, your autolyse was
successfull.

## Rubaud kneading #1

Please note that kneading times depend on the flour that you are using. The
numbers in this guide have shown the best results for my setup. The only way
to find out for yourself is to A/B test. Try alternating kneading times
between doughs that you make.

**The goal of kneading is to create a lot of strength in your dough.**

Set a timer for around 8 minutes and start kneading your bread using the
rubaud method. This inflates your dough with air. At the same time it
creates the desired strength. Strength is equal to a strong gluten
network. This allows your dough to stay in shape and not turn out flat in
later stages.

The process is best explained in this video. Basically you form your hand into
a shovel and dig in below the dough. Take the hand back out, stretching the
dough. By each digging in you add air. By each stretch you create additional
strength. Rotate the dough from time to time. You will notice that the dough
becomes less sticky. The dough stretches more nicely and does not fall apart.
The more you do this, the more this becomes visible.

I suggest to do this by hand because you develop a dough conscience. With
every dough you make, you will feel whether it is ready or not. As kneading
times differ from flour to flour, developing an understanding is important.
This allows you to adapt with different parameter changes.

To finish the process, stretch and fold the dough on top of each other. Don't
worry, you likely have some dough stuck to your hands. Just use some water to
wash the dough off.

## Add salt

Salt has a negative influence on both gluten network and fermentation times.
The yeast and bacteria works slower with salt added. That's why we add the
salt after the initial rubaud kneading. We will be adding 8 grams of salt,
equaling 2% of the flour mass.

## Rubaud kneading #2

Repeat the same process as you did initially for another 8 minutes. Your dough
should stick together way more now. It will naturally turn back and resist you
with every stretch that you do.

Wait for 15 minutes before proceeding with the next step. This allows the
dough to relax a little and become shapable easier.

## Lamination

Only recently I learned about lamination and like to add that to every bread
that I bake now. It adds additional strength to your dough. The dough is
spread apart, then folded back on top of each other. Because it is sticky, it
will stick to itself. Because of the folds, it will stick to itself on
multiple layers. This creates lots of strength. Some people even skip the
rubaud kneading and just use lamination. My tests have shown that a
combination of both creates a superb amount of strength. Only with that
level of dough strength my loafs would not flatten out in the oven. They would
expand nicely and create beautiful looking ears during the bake. Exactly what
I wanted.

Wet the work bench in front of you and place your dough on the bench from the
container. Do one more stretch and fold before taking the dough out of the
container. Take the dough out with a swift move, to not tear it too much.
Wet your hands again and carefully pull the dough apart in a rectangular shape.
It should look like a large rectangular pizza in front of you. The thickness
of the dough should be even in that rectangular shape. Make sure your dough
does not pull apart by tearing it too much apart. Be very gentle. Once the
dough starts sticking too much to your hands, wet them again.

Note that your dough now very likely sticks to the surface slightly. With
wetted hands, or your dough scraper to gently lift 1/6th of the dough upwards
and fold it over the next 1/6th. Repeat this process until you have a long
piece of dough. Now start folding that large piece of dough on top of each
other again until you have a small rectangular piece of dough in front of you.
The dough should stay in its shape and not flatten out. This is because
internally the layers of dough now nicely stick to each other. You developed a
lot of strength. This part is fundamental for all the following steps.

## Bulk fermentation

After adding your starter to the dough the bulk fermentation phase starts. It
is called bulk fermentation, because bakers usually bake more than 1 bread.
They bake multiple in bulk. The dough will be cut into smaller pieces at a
later stage. During bulk fermentation the dough rests together in bulk in one
large container.

**The goal is to let the dough ferment**. With the fermentation process the
yeast starts eating the dough, producing gas and other enzymes. This way your
dough inflates, creating the pockets of air. At the same time the bacteria
starts eating too. The bacteria creates the lactic acid, typicial for a
sourdough.

This process takes time. I would blindly follow guides telling me 4 hours, 5
hours, 6 hours, 24 hours. I didn't read the guides carefully enough. I could
never reproduce the results from the recipes. I had to learn the hard way how
important fermentation temperatures are. The factors influencing fermentation
times are:

* Amount of starter used
* Temperature
* Amount of salt

Changing one of those factors increases or decreases the bulk fermentation
time. Longer fermentation times create more gas, more taste but might also
cause your dough to degrade. You have to find a combination that works for
you. I would always resort to around 20% starter. That's the right amount of
starter to allow my bread to properly ferment over a short period of time. To
visualize the dependencies of all the parameters
[http://wraithnj.com/breadpics/rise_time_table/bread_model_bwraith.htm](I like to look at this table).
The table shows you how different temperatures, ratios of starter and salt
influence the fermentation and baking times. Please note that this is a model
that can not be applied to every dough directly. In a perfect world where we
all had the same sourdough this might be true. Your fermentation times are
likely different. I only use that table as a reference value. The table
suggests you based on the salt percentage, starter percentage as well as room
temperature how long it takes to bulk ferment and proof your dough.

TODO add example here

In my case I store the dough in a container in my bathroom. I have consistent
23°C to 24°C throughout the year. That way I have an environment where I can
reproduce the same bulk ferment over and over. I have been struggling with
this a lot. I would read that you need to wait for your dough to increase in
size, but that never happened as much as other people described. Furthermore I
couldn't find a way how to properly keep track of the progress.

Then I discovered an excellent trick. Take a small piece of your dough and
store it in a glas. Cover it up, take a pen or a rubber band and mark the glas
at the initial top position. Since both the dough in the glas as well as in
your bulk fermentation container have the same properties, you can use the
small dough as a reference. The moment the dough has doubled (TODO) in size
your bulk fermentation is done. You can safely proceed with the next steps.

TODO - add picture of process

During the bulk fermentation phase the yeast feeds on your dough and inflates
the dough with gas. The bacteria adds lactic acid to your dough. The inflation
causes your dough to increase in size. The tiny pockets of air create you the
open crumb ultimately. The gas is not evenly released throughout your dough.
Parts of your dough are inflated with more gas, other parts with less gas.
This means that the crumb by default will look relatively uneven.

This is why you should stretch and fold. The folds will even out the crumb and
create additional strength in your dough. The strength is created by lifting
the dough on top of each other. You are creating layers that stick to each
other well. Building that additional strength is very important to allow your
dough to rise upwards in the oven later on. I can't stress enough how
important this is. Mastering this can make up to poor initial kneading. A few
folds in you will notice how the dough suddenly starts to feel different. It
has inflated, because of that less of the surface comes into contact with your
hands. The dough becomes less sticky suddenly. It's a great feeling as you
finally see all the previous work coming together.

The technique to choose when doing stretch and folding is called `Coil
folding`. This technique is very gentle on your dough. Some techniques will
tear your dough apart. The moment that happens, you are losing precious gas
and thus structure. Your crumb will not be as open. I found this technique to
be the most effective, while being very easy to apply.

1. Wet your hands with cold water
2. Carefully remove the dough from the edges of your bulk fermentation
   container, or the bottom. Try not to tear the dough too much. If the dough
   starts sticking to your hands, water your hands again.
3. Place the bowl in front of you. Place both hands below the dough at at
   around 75% in of the dough. 0% being directly at the edge in front of you,
   100% in the far rear.
4. Place the 25% edge that now hangs downwards at the bottom of the container.
   Place the other 75% on top. That way the 25% are now at the bottom, the 75%
   have been placed on top. You have a created a layer.
5. Repeat this once from each side until you have a nice looking rectangle of
   dough in front of you.

Note that after each coil fold your dough starts looking smoother and
smoother. Your dough should also feel less sticky. The dough stays in shape
more and more.

I suggest doing this once every hour during bulk fermentation. If time does
not allow, you can also do this once every 2 hours. Some people do more folds
early in the bulk fermentation and less in later stages. If you have no time
at all, you can also skip this step alltogether. I do that sometimes, but then
my dough really deflates while trying to shape it. The additional layers are
missing and the dough is not able to retain all the gas. Furthermore the crumb
is very wild and not even. You might end up having thumb size alveoli in your
bread.

TODO - video of coil folding

In my setup at 23°C to 24°C bulk fermentation is usually done after 6-7 hours.
By then the dough has doubled in size. Interestingly the increase in size
mostly happens in the later stages of the bulk ferment. I might not see any
size increase for 3 hours, but then suddely huge increase in size the last 4
hours.

Before starting the next phase perform one last coil fold.

## Preshape

Preshaping happens immediately after the bulk fermentation phase completes. You convert
the shaggy mass of dough into something that you can shape into a nice loaf.

Make sure you have a large surface area available on which you can use your
dough scraper. Make sure you do not flour the surface. This is important. You
want your dough to stick to the surface.

Wet your hands one more time and with both hands remove the dough from the
bulk fermentation container and place it on your surface. If you plan to bake
one single loaf out of the dough, skip cutting the dough into smaller pieces.
When splitting it is important that you split the dough very concise with speed.
Ideally you require a maximum of 2 cuts to spread out the dough into 2 equal sizes.
Be very gentle since you do not want to have negative effects on the crumb of the
bread that you bake. To get the best open crumb, you do not want to cut the dough.
But there is no way around it, so reduce the cuts to a minimum.

The process is the same per piece of dough that you have in front of you. In
case you split the dough you have n pieces in front of you. If you bake 1
loaf, then you will have 1 piece of dough. Just repeat the same process per
loaf in front of you.

The whole process is best shown with a video. TODO add video. At an angle use
the dough scraper to push the dough forward over the surface. Use your other
hand to rotate the dough slightly. Lift the dough up, bring it back in front
of you. Repeat the same process until the dough surface looks very silky. The
dough should be round and not spread out too fast. This only works because
there was no flour on the surface. Because the dough sticks to the surface you
can make it stick to itself. Be advised that it takes quite a while to master
this technique.

One thing that happened to me often was that my dough was way too sticky at
this stage. When using the dough scraper chunks of dough just stuck. When
debugging the issue I could pinpoint it to:

1. My sourdough was too acidy
2. I did not create enough strength while kneading the dough
3. I did not bulk ferment my dough long enough
4. I bulk fermented my dough for too long.

Now to the reasons why you want to preshape:

1. Giving the dough additional strength after the bulk fermentation
2. Evening out the alveoli that formed during bulk fermentation to create a more even open crumb
3. Cutting the dough into smaller pieces and repairing some of the damages done

After your bulk fermentation the dough might be overly elastic. It might have
spread out a little too much. This would mean that you require additional
folds to shape the dough into a loaf that you can proof afterwards. We want to
be as careful as possible with the loaf, doing gentle as few as possible
actions at this stage. Preshaping causes your dough do stick together as you
tuck it onto itself. This creates a lot of strength and tension in your loaf.

Because of tucking the dough onto itself you create tension. This causes the
alveoli in your bread to become smaller. Some of them fade, some of them can
be split into smaller ones. You might have incredible big deposits of gas
after bulk fermenting. By chance some of them have created a very big bubble.
Some of those bubbles are so big that you can easily put 3 fingers through
them. Preshaping evens out the crumb of your loaf.

When you bake you want to have a proper testing setup. That's why it is good
to have exactly the same dough, but for instance alternate scoring pattern.
During preshape you split your loaf into smaller pieces. In larger bakeries
this happens too. The bulk fermented dough is split into equal size chunks.

## Bench rest

After you shaped your dough into a nice ball you want it to elongate a little
bit again. It should not turn too flat, but a little flatter so that you have
the right size to shape your loaf. Times again depend on the temperature in
your kitchen, how much strength your created and so on. But I usually let my
dough bench rest for around 15 minutes. During those 15 minutes your dough
becomes more elastic and ferments further.

While bench resting you do not cover your dough. This means if you bench rest
too long, your dough might dry out. That's important to understand, if your
dough dries out the surface will tear apart.

Here still further research needs to be done on all the parameters.

## Shape

Shaping is the process of converting your fermented dough into the shape that
your dough should have after baking. Based on shaping you can either create a
boule, a baguette, a country bread. Until this point the process is the same
for most of the breads. Shaping is what differentiates the different loafs.
Proper shaping is important to create the final level of strength in your
dough. A properly shaped loaf has more oven spring than a loaf where shaping
was done poorly.

This is also probably the hardest part during the whole process. It took me at
least 10 attempts to get this right. Even now after having baked many loafs I
am still scared to perform this step. One small error and your work will fall
a part like a house of cards. It is incredibly frustrating to screw up here,
because all the work to create an open crumb bread will have been mostly for
nothing. The bread will still taste good, but the crumb will be dense, you
will not have proper oven spring, you will not be able to properly score the
bread. But do not give up, keep practicing this step until you feel more
comfortable.

Your dough should not be sticky. It should look smooth and silky. I often
wondered why I can't shape my loaf. The reason was not my shaping technique,
it was a too sour dough, improper fermentation or wrong flour combination. If
you pinch your dough slightly with a watered finger, your dough should not
stick to it. It should stay in shape.

TODO (pictures)

Before we get started we need to ready our baneton. Flour your baneton with
rice flour. Rice flour has been the winning combination for me. I experimented
with semolina flour and regular flour as well. In all experiments rice flour
worked best. Don't save on adding rice flour to your baneton, more works
better. I then later on brush off any excess flour before the bake. I am
stressing this point, because a dough sticking to your baneton is the worst
nightmare of a baker. You can say good bye to your desired crumb and oven
spring. Make sure the linen of your baneton has rice flour everywhere. At the
bottom of the baneton add a little more rice flour. That is where your dough
will apply the highest pressure on your baneton.

Lightly flour the surface on which you will conduct the shaping process. Do
not add too much flour. I learned this the hard way. Too much flour impedes
the whole process as you can not make the dough stick to itself. It's
perfectly fine that the bottom part of your dough sticks to the surface.

With your dough scraper move to the right end of your preshaped dough. It
should by now have spread a little. This is normal as the gluten relaxes after
some time. Probably around 50% larger in diameter in comparison to directly
after the pre-shaping.

1. Push the dough while rotating the dough until you can lift the dough with
   your dough scraper.
2. Quickly flip the dough and place the previously top side of the dough on
   the floured surface.

The top side is smooth and silky. We want that side to be at the top of the
loaf when baking it. The bottom side stuck to the table. This side is not as
inflated as the other side. Thus it is also way more sticky than the nicely
inflated side. We basically want the smooth silky side to be at the top again.
This is what we need to achieve with the next steps.

The overall process is very similar to the lamination we did initially. Place
a little bit of flour on the table next to you. We need to slightly flour our
hands for this step.

1. Pull the dough slightly apart. We need to increase the size of the surface.
   The more surface we have, the more the dough can stick to itself.
2. Lift the bottom part of the dough and fold it to the middle of the loaf.
3. Gently tap the dough together. This will create strength. This works so
   well because the uneven previously bottom sides are put on top of each other.
4. Take the left hand side of the dough and place it a little further than the
   middle in front of you.
5. Hold the dough so that it will not spread back.
6. Take the right hand side of the dough and place it over the previously
   placed left hand side of the dough. Pull it as far as you can, without
   tearing the dough. You need to remove your left hand in the right moment.
   If you pull it too late, your hands will stick to the dough. This took me
   a while to master properly.
7. Pull the top left hand side to the middle of your dough. Keep holding that
   newly added fold.
8. Pull the top right hand side over the left hand side. It's the same with
   all the steps. We are creating layers of strength by making each layer
   stick to each other.
9. Your shaped dough should now look more or less like a rounded rectangle.
10. Take the top left side again, pull it into the middle. Pull the right hand
   side over the left hand side again. This process is called stitching. We
   are stitching together the parts of the dough in the center of the dough.
11. Repeat this whole process all the way through the center. Be careful to
   not be too brutal. You have to be gentle. Again this only works if you did
   not add excessive flour. With too much flour the dough can not stick to
   itself. Be quick and gentle with every move of your hands. If you hold the
   dough too long it will stick to your hands. If this happens, put your hands
   into the flour you previously placed on your table.
12. Pull the top side of the dough slightly and roll it over to the top
   quarter of your dough. With both hands keep pulling the dough from the
   surface and roll it further. Keep doing this until the smooth and silky side
   of the dough is now on the top. Your dough should look slightly oval now.
13. Use your bench scraper and push in the right hand side of the dough
   slightly. Not too much, because we don't want to create a boule.
14. Do the same process from the left hand side. Push the dough one more time
   from the bottom side and then a last time from the top side. This will
   create additional strength. Note how the surface of your dough increases in
   tension.
15. Take your bench scraper again, lift the whole dough. Quickly place it with
   the smooth silky side at the bottom of the baneton. The side that looks
   towards you like does not pretty. Do not worry, before baking the baneton
   is flipped. This side will be ultimately the bottom side of the loaf

TODO add some pictures here.

Cover your baneton so that your dough does not dry out. Place the dough in
your fridge.

## Proofing.

After shaping the proof stage commences. The proof stage allows your dough to
inflate again after having lost a little bit of gas during the shaping stage.
During the proof stage your dough is going to double in size. The
micro-organisms continue eating your dough, creating gas and acid.

Being an engineer I like to be able to reproduce each step as much as
possible. The fridge is an excellent way to do so. It is the only place
in my flat that has a constant temperature throughout the year. This is
excellent because the time required to complete this step then stays the same
with every additional bake. If you underproofed your dough you can just let it
rest for a few more hours on the next bake. If you overproofed your dough,
take your dough out of the fridge a little faster.

With my room temperature of around 20-22°C the dough finishes proofing after
around 2-3 hours.  At room temperature you can poke the dough slightly with
a floured finger. The dough should inflate again, leaving no signs that you
poked the dough. If it stays deflated, your dough is overproofed. 2-3 hours
of proofing time is equivalent to to 24 hours in my fridge (5°C). This poking
test does not work on a refridgerated dough. At a cooler temperature your
micro-organisms slow down. At a certain temperature they simply stop doing
their job completely. Make sure your fridge is not set to freezing
temperatures.

This process is known as cold-retarding the dough. Several people claim that
this fridge-fermentation improves the overall taste of your dough. I can
confirm that this is the case, but did not find any scientific sources yet to
confirm this claim.

The biggest advantage of this cold-retarding is the cooled gas inside of your
dough. The final volumne of the dough is the same after proofing at room
temperature in comparison to proofing in the fridge. However the fridge
proofed dough has been inflated with gases that now have a colder temperature.
The moment the gases heat up, they will increase in volume. This is exactly
what you want, because this will inflate your dough in the oven even further.
The consequence is an enhanced open crumb and better oven spring.

Sometimes when in a rush I proof the dough for an hour at room temperature and
then another 12 hours in the fridge. Or sometimes even slightly longer at room
temperature. Regardless I always make sure that the last phase is in the
fridge to have the gas-expansion effect during the bake.

Don't worry too much if you can not bake your dough directly after 24 hours.
In my experiments I could let the dough ferment for even longer up to 48 hours
in the fridge. It seems that most of the benefitial microorganism activity is
happening while the dough cools down from 20°C to 5°C in the fridge. At 5°C it
seems that there is almost no activity by the microorganisms.

## Heating up the oven and your lava rocks

Almost done - with the whole process. We need to ready the oven for the bake.

1. Place the baking stone/steel in your oven
2. In a large container place your lava rocks at the bottom of your oven

It is important that your stone and your rocks are as hot as possible. The
water inside of your dough will evaporate and expand your dough, creating the
oven spring. This works best if the surface on which you place your dough is
very hot. It is the same process when baking pizza.

The lava rocks have to be hot because we will pour boiling water on them
before the bake. This creates a lot of steam in your oven. This steam is
crucial for the bake. The steam is important because it prevents the
maillard-reaction of your crust. The crust prevents the dough from inflating
even further in the oven. You will end up having large alveoli in the top
facing part of your dough, close to the crust. The steam mitigates crust
creation. However - everyone loves a crunchy crust. Thus we only add steam for
half the time of the bake. The second half is there to create that crunchy
crust.

I have conducted multiple experiments with different steaming techniques.
The lava rocks technique has created me the best loafs consistently.
Another popular method is to use a dutch oven. The dutch oven traps the steam
that is created while the water from your dough evaporates. I've achieved
almost similar results when I sprayed the dutch oven with additional water
from the inside. However the lava rocks method has been the winner in all my
experiments.

In my case that is around 45 minutes of pre-heating the oven at 270°C. The final
baking temperature will be 230°C. Do not worry if your oven does not get as hot.
Lower temperatures are fine too.

## Add kitchen towels with boiling water

I have learned about the kitchen towel method from another fellow baker. The
idea is to soak them in water to provide a continous source of steam during
the whole bake. This method has been what elevated my oven spring to a level
where I am now fully satisfied with the results. The lava rocks are great for
the initial steam, but soon after do not create enough steam for the whole
process.

1. Heat water in a water cooker until the water boils
2. Place as many towels as you can in a container
3. Pour the boiling water over the kitchen towels
4. Place the container with the kitchen towels in the oven next to the lava
   rocks

Since the water lost a little bit of temperature when being poured over the
kitchen towels we will continue to heat the box including the towels for
another 15 minutes. Once done your lava rocks had a full 60 minutes of
pre-heating and your kitchen towels around 15 minutes.

## Place loaf on peel

We need to load our peel with the loaf. To do that we will be placing a little
bit of parchment paper on the peel. You could also go with semolina flour
only. However if the bread starts sticking just a little bit to the peel you
are screwed. The damage to the structure of your loaf can not be fully
repaired. The bread will taste delicious regardless, but will not offer the
same beautiful visual features. That's why to be safe I always suggest the
parchment paper method.

So let's get started with loading the peel.

1. Semolina flour the top of your loaf slightly
2. Place the pizza peel with the parchment paper on top of your baneton
3. Hold the baneton tight and flip the baneton with the pizza peel over

This method has proven to be most effective. Some people like to directly flip
over the baneton onto the peel. Using that method your dough will not land as
gently on the pizza peel though. It will have a higher speed of impact when
landing. Remember, we want to be as gentle as possible to avoid degasing and
damaging the open crumb structure. Seeing other people employing this brute
force method hurts a lot. The method with flipping the baneton and the peel
is much more gentle and the best way to create the crumb we are looking for.

The loaf should now now lay in front of you on the parchment papered pizza
peel.

## Brush off flour

Due to the high hydration we had to utilise a lot of flour in the baneton.
Without the flour the dough would have sticked. Biting into a piece of bread
that still has flour on the crust is something I personally don't like. In
fact many testers of my bread had complained about this initially. Luckily we
can correct this and even kill two birds with one stone. Brushing off the
flour has another advantage. By having a watery surface tiny blisters are
created during the bake (TODO - it would be nice to explain this
scientifically - why does it happen?). Those tiny blisters are considered as a
defect by some bakers. In my opinion it makes the bread much more beautiful
and also adds another layer of crunchiness. This only works if the surface of
the loaf is not covered in excessive flour.

1. Take the brush and gently brush off all the flour
2. Try not to harm the surface of the dough
3. Don't worry if there is now flour on the parchment paper, you can try to
   brush it off, or alternatively let it stay during the bake. The flour will
   ultimately burn slightly, some people don't like that. Then it is best to
   remove it.

## Score loaf

Scoring is the process where you cut your loaf with a knife before the bake.
Historically shared ovens were used in villages. A certain scoring pattern
would indicate that a particular loaf belongs to you.

Today scoring is mostly done because of a side-effect that is very beneficial.
It is is done to create a weakness in the surface of the bread. As the dough
expands during the bake it will mostly expand through that weakness that you
created. If you do not score your dough your bread will burst at other weak
spots, usually those where you tucked your dough together during the shaping
process. There are some breads like a rye bread, or a portuguese corn bread
where that behavior is desired. Since we are baking a gluten gas monster we
want to control that process as much as we can. So scoring is essential to
allow the bread to properly expand during the bake. Without scoring you can
not achieve the desired result. To me the perfect loaf has a large cut from
the top to the bottom. Through that cut the bread expanded during the bake. If
you look closely the cut looks like a tectonic plate on top of another plate.
Bakers are calling this `the ear`. If you achieved this once, you never want
to go back. The ear is slightly more burnt than other parts of your loaf,
having a unique taste. It looks very appealing from a visual perspective, in
my opinion the perfect loaf. This is the kind of bread you want to bring when
you have been invited by friends.

Unfortunately this is also a very difficult step in the whole process. I am
still yet to find a way how to better practice this without using a loaf of
bread. I would be very happy if someone has a suggestion here. The problem is
that you have exactly 1 attempt per bread, if you screw that up, good bye oven
spring. Since I don't bake large scale quantities of bread I don't have 400
loafs per day on which I can practice. So even today I am always a little
scared of screwing this step up, since it is so essential.
