# Open Crumb Sourdough

The goal of this recipe is to create fluffy sourdough bread that features an
excellent open crumb. The crumb should have evenly spread alveoli. The crust
of the bread should be thick and crispy, feeling almost like if it was fried.
That way you experience two different consistencies thus creating a more
wholesome taste experience.

Please note that this is by far the most complex bread you can bake. All the
parameters depend on each other. If you commit a small error at one of the steps,
chances are you will not be able to create similar product. It has taken me
approx. 200 attempts and 400 hours to get this recipe right. This is also by
far the most time intensive bread that I have baked in the past. The dough
requires working, you need to carefully observe fermentation. 2 hour per loaf
is a realistic time. It would be interesting to know if similar bread can be
achieved by using more tools, or whether it remains artisan craftsmanship.

Furthermore different temperatures, different flours all result in you require
handling the dough differently. Throughout this guide I will explain all
the pitfalls I encountered with possible fixes. I have always used the same
base recipe, trying to only change 1 parameter at the time. That way I could
improve from bread to bread. I tried to be as scientific as possible, but
sometimes I accidentally changed multiple parameters. Sometimes I would do one
step a few minutes later simply because I had to finish drinking a beer, going
to the toilet. It's very hard to repeat exactly the same process throughout
every bake, but try your best!

Do not feel demotivated if you can not complete the recipe with similar results
right away. Feel free to open up an issue here on the repository to receive

## Preparing your starter

The foundation of every bread is a healthy sourdough starter. A small portion
of sourdough is mixed into your bread to start the fermentation process. This
dough is called the starter or levain. I had to learn the importance the hard
way. In fact, I had started to master all the steps, what was missing was
simply a healthy starter. So simple, but I was so much focused on my
technique that it took me a long time to realise that the foundation of my
baking was weak.

The breads I made had great taste, but very visually not appealing.
When working the dough it almost always stuck to my hands. The dough was super
sticky. I was wondering how people could handle such sticky dough? Most
recipes call for something around 75-85% hydration. That's 85 grams of water
per 100 grams of flour. The dough in my case stuck to my hands, kitchen
surface and ultimately the baneton. Loafs with 65 or 70% hydration would turn
out okay - not having significant oven spring.

My sourdough was too sour. The sourness in your your sourdough comes from
bacteria that produces lactic and acetic acid. This acid infuses the sour
taste to your dough. At the same time the acid improves shelf life of your
product, preventing mold from entering your dough. The reason why your dough
sticks together during fermentation is gluten. Gluten also traps the air
created by the fermentation in your your dough. A healthy strong gluten
network is the basis for baking a bread that has an open crumb and rises well
in your oven.

So my starter `Breadly Cooper` seemed to produce too much acid. I verified
this by buying a pH measuring device. My starter would have a pH before baking
of around 3.2. Whereas other peoples starter was less acidy. The acid impedes
the development of the gluten network. At some point the network is damaged.
Thus your bread then just turns into a sticky mess. I was shocked to learn
that my 2 year old sourdough might have reached its end of life. But that is
normal. You might at some point have added different bacteria. That bacteria
ferments faster and creates more acid. Overall your sourdough is a living
organism. You might want to try creating a new sourdough.

Another factor contributed to my lack of oven spring and dough flatness. I
would usually ferment my doughs over night, as the dough would not grow as
much as it did for others. Then after a couple of tests I realised a warmer
temperature is beneficial. Regardless, my sourdough would never double within
4 hours in size. So I had to increase my fermentation times. My dough became
much easier to work with after exchanging the starter. I could do stretch and
folds, my hands were not covered in dough after. However - after 8 hours of
fermentation or so the dough suddenly turned into a sticky mess again. It
seems that over time your dough naturally degrades, several sources describe a
so called `Gluten rot`. Since enzymes become activated after water is added,
the gluten is slowly transformed. Which makes sense, since the seed needs
sugars to grow. A similar process has been used for thousands of years when
brewing beer. This means you can not simply let your dough ferment for longer
time to compensate for lack of gas development by your yeast. You have to
maximise fermentation speed in a short period of time. This seems especially
true for doughs that have high hydration.

This means, you need to make sure your sourdough is super active. My freshly
created sourdough would need around 8 hours to double in size at room
temperature. I saw videos and guides where people explained how their
sourdough could triple in size in 4 hours.

The quantity of yeast plus its activity in your sourdough is essential.
To make sure your yeast is as active as possible you need to feed it. This
means if you have your sourdough in your fridge, it can take up to 3 full days
to get it to its same activity levels again, before freezing it. Furthermore a
freshly created sourdough might need more time to become active. In fact it
took me approx. 2 weeks to get my sourdough to a state where it was active
enough. Feeding your starter with rye can help, as rye naturally has more
yeast contamination. You should only do that from time to time, as rye in
general impedes gluten development. I like to have a variety of different
yeast and bacteria in my sourdough.

So lets get your sourdough nuclear. This guide assumes you already have a
sourdough starter. If not, you first need to make one.

For 4 days in a row you will do the following, twice per day:
1. Take 40 grams of sourdough
2. Feed it with 40 grams of full grain flour
3. Apply 40 grams of water.

The water should be around 20-28°C. It's important it is not too cold.
Temperature greatly impacts fermentation times.

Take a rubber band, or a pen to indicate the initial expansion of your dough.
This allows you to see how active your sourdough is. Place the container in a
warm environment in your house/flat. It shouldn't be too cold. In my case I
placed the dough in my bathroom where I constantly had around 22°C.

After 12 hours return to your sourdough and check whether it has expanded in
size. Take a new jar and repeat the same process with now 40 grams of
sourdough from the initial feeding. This means your sourdough always has fresh
flour to feed on. You divide it into 1/3. This also has the advantage to leave
over fermented, too sour parts away. In the jar from the initial feeding you
should still have some sourdough left, probably around 75 grams, as you always
lose some product during fermentation. This old sourdough could be used to
bake a rye, emmer or einkorn bread - anything that does not need gluten
development. You could also make sourdough pancakes, sourdough crips,
sourdough pasta, or anything you please with it. Some bakers just discard that
sourdough. I like to store that highly fermented sourdough in an additional
jar in my fridge, ready for use whenever I please.

After 4 days your sourdough should be way more active than it was before. If
it is not, then you need to repeat this process. As suggested, eventually
switch to rye feeding for a day. My sourdough is able to rise to 3 times
its size within 4 hours. Baking a bread with an open crumb does not work
if your sourdough is not similarly active. I had to learn this the hard way.

I usually get up at 8 AM the day I want to bake. I had fed my sourdough in the
night at 10 PM. I won't use that starter to bake, instead I feed the sourdough
one more time in the morning. I place that sourdough starter in my oven with
lights on. That way I have around 27°C in the oven. After 4 hours the sourdough
has tripled in size. If it does - you are ready to go. You have the rock solid
basis to bake an amazing bread.
