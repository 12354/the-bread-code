## Motivation

Did you ever relish the taste of a fresh and warm bread with a crispy crust? Do you know the sound of the crispy crust when you take bite? And have you ever experienced the delicious and homey scent of a bread coming right out of the oven?

When baking a bread you experience a whole variety of emotions and senses. Furthermore, you step into a world, where simplicity can become very complex. However, reaching perfection is amazing! The feeling of having crafted a perfect combination of all natural ingredients is unique and so special. I say “a perfect combination”, not “the perfect combination” because that is the secret. There is no such thing as the perfect bread. There are so many different possibilities, combinations, ingredients, parameters — every bread is unique!
